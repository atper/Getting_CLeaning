* Data Set Information

The original data is from an experiment carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

The final dataset contains average of the the mean and standard deviation measurements for each activity and each subject.

* Variables
subject: Subject identifies (1-30).
activity: Six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
tBodyAcc-mean()-X
: Average of the corresponding variables for each activity and each subject.
Other variables are the same as tBodyAcc-mean()-X.
